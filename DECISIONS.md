## 2026-10-16 — Set up Git before GitHub
Chose: Git before GitHub
Other option: GitHub before Git
Why: GitHub stores snapshots of Git, so without Git there would be nothing for GitHub to store

## 2026-10-16 — Make .gitignore before the first commit
Chose: make .gitignore before the first commit
Other option: make the first commit before .gitignore
Why: if I commit first, node_modules and .env would get included and uploaded to GitHub

## 2026-10-19 — Protect main with CI
Chose: turn on branch protection for main
Other option: leave main unprotected
Why: so CI always checks the code, even if I forget, and broken code can't get into main

## 2026-10-29 — Keep decisions in DECISIONS.md, not a docs/adr folder
Chose: keep writing every decision in the one DECISIONS.md file
Other option: start a docs/adr folder with a separate file for each decision
Why: I already have a list of decisions in DECISIONS.md, and one file is easier to read top to bottom than lots of small files

## 2026-10-29 — Turn branches and pull requests back on
Chose: every ticket gets its own branch and a pull request, and main only accepts changes after the tests pass
Other option: keep making changes straight on main, like we did after 2026-10-22
Why: I want to follow Matt Pocock's method exactly, and it uses a branch and a pull request for every ticket. It also means the tests always run before anything lands in main

## 2026-10-29 — Sort the server files by topic
Chose: one folder for books, one for friends, one for loans, with all 5 files for that topic inside
Other option: keep one folder per job, like all the "check the rules" files together and all the "talk to the database" files together
Why: when I work on loans, everything I need is in one folder instead of spread across five. It also fits building one small feature at a time, all the way through

## 2026-10-29 — Move one topic at a time
Chose: move books, check the app, then friends, check, then loans, check
Other option: move everything at once and check at the end
Why: if something breaks, I know exactly which step broke it

## 2026-10-29 — Check by hand, plus one small "server starts" test
Chose: try the app by hand after each move, and add one test that checks the server can find all its files and start
Other option: write real tests for the loan rules first, before moving anything
Why: the only test we had checked 1 + 1 = 2, so it couldn't catch anything. Moving files can break a file path, and the new test catches that. Tests for the loan rules are a bigger job, so they belong in tickets #5 and #6
