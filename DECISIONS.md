## 2026-10-16 — Set up Git before GitHub
Chose: Git before GitHub
Other option: GitHub before Git
Why: GitHub stores snapshots of Git, so without Git there would be nothing for GitHub to store

## 2026-10-16 — Make .gitignore before the first commit
Chose: make .gitignore before the first commit
Other option: make the first commit before .gitignore
Why: if I commit first, node_modules and .env would get included and uploaded to GitHub

## 2026-10-19 — Protect main with CI
Chose: turn on branch protection for main
Other option: leave main unprotected
Why: so CI always checks the code, even if I forget, and broken code can't get into main

## 2026-10-29 — Keep decisions in DECISIONS.md, not a docs/adr folder
Chose: keep writing every decision in the one DECISIONS.md file
Other option: start a docs/adr folder with a separate file for each decision
Why: I already have a list of decisions in DECISIONS.md, and one file is easier to read top to bottom than lots of small files

## 2026-10-29 — Turn branches and pull requests back on
Chose: every ticket gets its own branch and a pull request, and main only accepts changes after the tests pass
Other option: keep making changes straight on main, like we did after 2026-10-22
Why: I want to follow Matt Pocock's method exactly, and it uses a branch and a pull request for every ticket. It also means the tests always run before anything lands in main

## 2026-10-29 — Sort the server files by feature
Chose: one folder for each feature (books, friends, loans), with all 5 files for that feature inside
Other option: keep one folder per job, like all the "check the rules" files together and all the "talk to the database" files together
Why: when I work on loans, everything I need is in one folder instead of spread across five. It also fits building one small feature at a time, all the way through

## 2026-10-29 — Move one feature at a time
Chose: move books, check the app, then friends, check, then loans, check
Other option: move everything at once and check at the end
Why: if something breaks, I know exactly which step broke it

## 2026-10-29 — Check by hand, plus one small "server starts" test
Chose: try the app by hand after each move, and add one test that checks the server can find all its files and start
Other option: write real tests for the loan rules first, before moving anything
Why: the only test we had checked 1 + 1 = 2, so it couldn't catch anything. Moving files can break a file path, and the new test catches that. Tests for the loan rules are a bigger job, so they belong in tickets #5 and #6

## 2026-10-29 — Delete the 1 + 1 = 2 test
Chose: delete it
Other option: keep it next to the new "server starts" test
Why: it never checked anything about my app, so it only made the test count look bigger than it really is

## 2026-10-30 — Test the loan rules with a fake helper instead of a database
Chose: swap the database helper for a fake one that answers whatever each test needs, like "yes, Dune is already out"
Other option: run the tests against a pretend database that we fill with books and friends
Why: the rules only care about the answer, not where it comes from. The fake is quicker and needs no setup. Also, when we tried the pretend database inside our test tool (Jest), it crashed, and fixing that is a job for ticket #3

## 2026-10-30 — Keep each test file next to the file it tests
Chose: put the loan rule tests in the loans folder, right next to the loan rules
Other option: put all tests together in a separate tests folder
Why: we just sorted the server by feature, so everything about loans, tests included, should be in the loans folder

## 2026-10-30 — Test books against a pretend database, not my real one
Chose: a pretend database that starts empty for the tests and is thrown away after
Other option: run the tests against my real database
Why: tests that add Dune every time would fill my real shelf with copies of Dune. Also, CI runs on GitHub's computers, which can't reach my real database

## 2026-10-30 — Every test starts with an empty shelf and sets itself up
Chose: empty the pretend database before each test, and have each test add the books it needs
Other option: let a test use the books an earlier test added
Why: then each test works on its own and in any order, and an old copy of Dune can't sneak into the next test

## 2026-10-30 — Fix the pretend database so it opens inside our test tool
Chose: when the tests open the pretend database, hand it one small piece it needs (Node's "os" tool) ourselves
Other option: switch on a setting in our test tool (Jest) that's still marked "experimental"
Why: the pretend shelf wouldn't open inside Jest, so we couldn't test adding Dune at all. Jest was blocking the way the database code fetches that piece. Handing it over ourselves is one line in one place, and it doesn't rely on an experimental setting that might change
